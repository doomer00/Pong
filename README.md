# Pong Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Pong using Python and the Pygame library.

## Introduction

Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The game involves two paddles and a ball, with players competing to score points against each other by hitting the ball past the opponent's paddle.

This project presents a basic version of the Pong game developed in Python using the Pygame library, providing a simple player-versus-player experience and an AI opponent.

## Features

- Player-versus-player gameplay
- AI-controlled opponent
- Simple scoring system
- Basic game controls

## Installation

To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/pong.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Install the required dependencies using `pip install pygame`
5. Run the game by executing `python main.py` in the terminal.

## How to Play

- Launch the game using the installation instructions above.
- Use the provided controls (listed below) to move the paddles and hit the ball.
- Play against a friend or challenge the AI opponent.

## Controls

Player 1:
- **W**: Move the paddle up
- **S**: Move the paddle down

Player 2:
- **Up Arrow**: Move the paddle up
- **Down Arrow**: Move the paddle down

## Gameplay

- The game starts with both players' paddles positioned in the middle of the screen.
- The objective is to hit the ball past the opponent's paddle to score a point.

## Enhancements

Possible enhancements to further improve the game include:

- Refining the AI logic for the opponent's paddle movement
- Adding sound effects and background music
- Implementing a win screen with options to restart or exit
- Creating multiple difficulty levels for the AI opponent
